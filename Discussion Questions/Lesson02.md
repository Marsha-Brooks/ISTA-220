Discussion Questions Day Two
C# Step by Step
1.	What is a statement?
A statement is a command that performs actions; series of statements create methods.

methods, and variables. 
3.	What is a variable?
A variable is a storage location that holds a value, a box that holds temporary information.
4.	Are primitive types and value types the same thing? See page 177
Primitive types are built-in value types within C#.  So yes the primitive types are value types.
Once a data type is defined, it must be given a value.
5.	How are arithmetic operator and variable types related?
Arithmetic operators and variable types are related in that Arithmetic operators act on values to create new values and variables created and assigned values.  Both the Operator and the variables manipulate and effect the values assigned within the program.
6.	How do you turn an integer into a string?
To convert an integer into a string you use the ToString Method.
7.	How do you turn a string into an integer?
To covert a string to an integer you use the int32.Parse Method.
8.	What is the difference between precedence and associativity?
The difference between precedence and associativity is that precedence is the established rule of which  operators are calculated first by order of precedence, where associativity pertains to a situation where you have operators of the same precedence to calculate and they are calculated left to right.

9.	How are prefix and postfix increment operators assigned and figured?
They affect the operand where they are.  Before gets assigned before, after gets assigned after
The operation takes place.

10.	What is string interpolation?
Using of $ symbol at the beginning saying anything in {} is replaced by string?
(“My name is $name”); Combines strings for more compact readable code.
