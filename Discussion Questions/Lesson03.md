Discussion Questions
Day three
C# Programming
1.	 What is a Method?
Named sequence of statements, named block of code
2.	What does a return statement do?
specifies the kind of information the method  returns as a result of its processing.
Ends execution of the function.
3.	What is an expression bodied method?
very simple method that performs a single task or returns the results of a calculation without involving any additional logic.
4.	What is the scope of a variable?
A variable comes into existence at the point where it is defined, and subsequent statements in the method can then use this variable; where this variable is applicable is its “scope”
5.	What is an overloaded method? “Polymorphism!!
If two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope. You can overload a method when the different implementations have different sets of parameters—that is, when they have the same name but a different number of parameters or when the types of the parameters differ.

6.	How do you call a method that requires arguments?
To pass an argument as a named parameter, you specify the name of the parameter, followed by a colon and the value to use.  In parentheses immediately after method call.

7.	How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, 
That requires a parameter list?

you supply a comma-separated list of arguments, and the number and type of the arguments are used by the compiler to select one of the overloaded method.

8.	 How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method?

You specify that a parameter is optional when you define a method by providing a default value for the parameter. You indicate a default value by using the assignment operator

9.	How do you pass an argument to a method as a named parameter?
By default, C# uses the position of each argument in a method call to determine which parameter the argument applies to
