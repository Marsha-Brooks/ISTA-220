C# Programming Lesson 5

1.	 What is a compound assignment operator?  How does it work?
a.	It combines the assignment operator and the arithmetic operator
b.	It performs an additional arithmetic function on the result
2.	 List all the compound assignment operators
a.	/=
b.	*=
c.	%=
d.	+=
e.	-=
3.	 List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric 
Variable by 50.
a.	 Int=int+=5
b.	Int+=5
c.	Int=int-50
d.	Int-=50
4.	 How long does a while loop run? 
a.	Until the control variable is reaches the right value
5.	 What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while block?
a.	You cause an infinite loop
6.	How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any part of it? Can you omit all
Parts of it.
a.	(initialization, Boolean Expression, Control Variable)
Statement (5)
b.	You can omit any part you want. You can omit all parts of its
i.	You will create an infinite loop or the for loop will not execute or you will create
ii.	A while loop.
iii.	Empty for loop runs forever with just parenthesis and commas, empty parenthesis will cause a compile error
7.	How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once? 
a.	Write a “do while loop” or use a continue statement
8.	 What does the break statement do?
a.	Exits the loop, ends the loop
9.	 What does the continue statement do?
a.	It forces the program to execute the next iteration immediately after 
The Boolean expression is evaluated.
