C# Programming Lesson 8 Discussion Questions

Road to MCSD
After review of the Microsoft Certified Professional Certification Paths, my current educational objective is to earn the required Microsoft Certified Solution Associate badges that lead ultimately to my Microsoft Certified Solution Developer certification.  The Application Builder Pathway.  All the examinations in question are building blocks of the Application Builder Pathway however, only the 70-480 and the 70-357 certifications are directly branched and the rest of the certifications are electives.   I have listed the outline for each certification beneath its title and what qualifications an applicant will retain if he or she successfully completes and is awarded the badge for the individual certification.  In addition, I have provided a list of resources below that are applicable to each certification that Microsoft provides.
 I would pursue the following examinations 70-483 Programming in C# and 70-486 Developing ASP.NET MVC Web applications before taking any of the listed electives, to accomplish the requirements to achieve the Microsoft Certified Solution Associate for Web Application and the Microsoft Certified Solution Associate in Universal Windows Platform.  These certifications most directly support my employment ambitions and educational objectives, the elective certifications could be part of my continued education program depending on the direction of my career.
The opportunity to pursue any of the electives that support the MCSD would obviously be beneficial to my educational objective, career path and ultimately my potential employer.  Replacing the current MSSA curriculum that requires the course to cover Windows 8 Store Builder with a selection from the App Builder electives would be very beneficial to the and the students.
